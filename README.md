Nexus v4 — Experimental AI Interface

Created by: Raj Mitra

Nexus v4 is a prototype browser-based AI agent interface designed for experimentation with human–machine interaction, memory systems, and modular model control.
It includes a dynamic model loader, temporal awareness system, custom UI framework, and early self-healing memory logic.

This project represents an evolving exploration into what an AI interface should feel like—not just how it functions.

🚀 Features

🧠 Dynamic Model Fetching (OpenRouter API compatible)

🧩 Modular UI Layout (panels, chat viewport, command input)

🎙 Speech + Agent Interaction Support (planned)

📁 File Upload Support for documents and images

🕒 Time-Anchored Agent Awareness

🔧 Custom Model Mode for unsupported providers

🧬 Self-Repair Memory System (prevents corrupted memory files)

⚡ No frameworks — runs client-side using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🛠️ How to Use

Download or clone this repository.

Open index.html in any Chromium-based browser.

Enter your OpenRouter API key in the Settings panel.

Select a model (or enter a custom model path).

Start interacting through the command window.
